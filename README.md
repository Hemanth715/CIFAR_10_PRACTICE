# CIFAR_10_PRACTICE
Practicing Convolutional Neural Networks with CIFAR 10 dataset

Just a basic practice of making a Convolutional Neural Network on the CIFAR 10 dataset

Set up the yml file and then install tensorflow-gpu to run on GPU

Downlaod CIFAR 10 dataset from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz
